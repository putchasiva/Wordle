This project was makde in Javascript, HTML and CSS. Basically the game is just like the regular worlde made by New York Times but this game has additional features. The origninal wordle only has one game mode where you can only guess 5 letter words but this version has 3 modes where you can guess 5, 6, and 7 letter words. Additionally, there's a reverse wordle where you have to guess the word based on seeing 5 guesses and you can also decide to do this mode with 5, 6, or 7 letter words. Additionaly, to make it more difficult, you can't use your keyboard to type the letters on the screen so you have to scroll down and click on the letters on the keyboard to type in your guesses.
